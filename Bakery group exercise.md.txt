BakeryApp
 (Links to an external site.)Your favorite bakery needs to create a database of its fresh goods!
You're in a team of 2 (or 3).
Create at least 15 baked goods and save it into a collection of data. Each baked good has a name, price, an expiration date, one or more diet restrictions (ie. gluten allergies), and quantity in stock. The program should allow the user to search by diet restrictions and print all matching results. For a list of example products, see https://sensitivesweets.com/collections/breads (Links to an external site.)
All processes must happen in Classes, not in the main method of a Main class.
